/**
 * Bidding languages represent a mean for the bidder to express a value for a certain set of goods.
 * Typically, bidding languages in SATS contain an iterator that defines by what logic a bidder provides bids when he
 * is asked for a new bid.
 * For example, we can ask a bidder to provide XOR bids, starting at the smallest bundle and increasing the size the
 * more bids we ask for (see {@link org.spectrumauctions.sats.core.bidlang.xor.IncreasingSizeOrderedXOR}).
 * Another example is to get (parametrized) random bids with the {@link org.spectrumauctions.sats.core.bidlang.xor.SizeBasedUniqueRandomXOR}
 *
 * A famous example of a more domain-specific iterator is described in CATS by Leyton-Brown et al. (2000).
 * The part that makes the domain most interesting is the algorithm on how the bidders bid based on some parameters.
 * If trying to imitate a bidding behavior is the focus in a certain model, such an iterator is essential to the model.
 *
 * On the other hand, if you are less interested in a specific bidding behavior, but are more interested in getting
 * the "most profitable" bids of the bidder in a certain model, you can find those by using a demand query MIP
 * (see {@link org.spectrumauctions.sats.opt.domain.DemandQueryMIP} (and setting the prices to zero if you just want
 * to find the most valuable bids).
